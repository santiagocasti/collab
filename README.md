collab
======
Collaborative offline web application over Local Area Network
------

Collab is a Google Chrome application built as a proof of concept of the usage of Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types in web application development. The goal is to demonstrate that CRDTs are capable of allowing web applications to work offline without having big problems for merging data once connectivity is recovered. Furthermore, the concept of offline collaboration over LAN is explored to allow sub-groups of users to work collavoratibely while disconnected from a central data repository.


Collab is built completely with web technologies (Javascript, CSS and HTML) and uses libraries and frameworks like AngularJS, NodeJS, and Jasmine aside from the Chrome Apps APIs.
